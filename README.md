# Instructions
Build a to-do app using the provided repo (this one). You need to be able to add, remove and "mark as complete" items in the todo list.

When you hit the "submit" button items should be added to the top of the to-do list.
When you hit the "remove" button items should be taken off the bottom of the list.
When you hit the "checkmark" (note that this can also be a button not necessarily a checkmark) it marks the item as complete and changes the to-do items text to be crossed out.

The order of this should operate like a queue. (FIFO)
